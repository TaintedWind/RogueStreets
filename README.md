RogueStreets
============

Created by Ilya Perkins - TaintedWind

This is my first game -ever- and I am using this project as a learning experience.

Rogue Streets is a top-down 2D shooter. It can be classified as a rogue-like game, hence the name.
You play the role of a survivor set in a post-apocalyptic world. The world has been distroyed by a virus
that has mutated 99% of the population. You are the 1%. You are somehow immune, and you must fight for your own survival.

You will, run, fight, build, and survive in this fast-paced shooter.

(All subject to change, description is not valid at the moment. This is outlook for the final game!)

Currently, it is under development by, well only me as of right now.
