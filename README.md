The original goal
-----------------

Rogue Streets is a top-down 2D shooter. It can be classified as a rogue-like game, hence the name.
You play the role of a survivor set in a post-apocalyptic world. The world has been distroyed by a virus
that has mutated 99% of the population. You are the 1%. You are somehow immune, and you must fight for your own survival.

You will, run, fight, build, and survive in this fast-paced shooter.

(All subject to change, description is not valid at the moment. This is outlook for the final game!)
