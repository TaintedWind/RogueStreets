Some things to be kept in mind while making the game.

Using slick2d

Thoughts:

Collision-
    Player collision with other players will NOT happen
    Then will cycle isNear() for all other mobs to determine the distance.
    
    If the mobs pass the initial isNear test 
        -can you check the direction moving towards the next frame?
        -store data, if the mob is closer the next frame than in the previous, keep checking for distance
        -if the mob is moving away from the player, do not check for isNear next frame
    When/If mob passes isColliding()
        -get the last point before the collision and determine the angle
        -move the mob in that direction, move the player less in the opposite, player will push mobs based on a value

    Mobs WILL collide with other mobs
    How to check every other mob's collision without checking against itself
    How to check against ech mob only once
